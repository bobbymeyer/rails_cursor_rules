# View Coding Style

This rule file defines view coding style and conventions.

## File Patterns
- `app/views/**/*.erb`: ERB templates
- `app/helpers/**/*.rb`: View helpers
- `app/views/layouts/*.erb`: Layout files

## View Conventions
- Use partials for reusable view components
- Use layouts for shared view structure
- Use helpers for view logic
- Use content_for for layout customization
- Use form builders (Simple Form)
- Use I18n for all text content
- Keep views focused and simple
- Follow progressive enhancement

## ERB Best Practices
- Use proper ERB tags (<%= %> for output, <% %> for logic)
- Minimize logic in views
- Use presenter objects for complex view logic
- Use proper HTML5 semantic elements
- Follow accessibility guidelines
- Keep indentation consistent
- Use comments for complex sections

## Form Conventions
- Use Simple Form for all forms
- Use proper form helpers
- Use form objects for complex forms
- Validate on both client and server
- Show proper error messages
- Use proper HTML5 input types
- Follow accessibility guidelines

## Helper Conventions
- Keep helpers focused and simple
- Use proper naming conventions
- Test helper methods
- Document complex helpers
- Use proper Ruby conventions
- Avoid complex logic in helpers
