# Code Organization

This rule file defines code organization conventions.

## File Patterns
- `app/**/*`: All application files
- `test/**/*`: All test files
- `config/**/*`: All configuration files

## Organization Conventions
- One class per file
- Use namespacing for related functionality
- Keep related files close together
- Use descriptive file names
- Use consistent file naming conventions
- Follow Ruby and Rails naming conventions
- Group related functionality in modules
- Use proper directory structure

## Directory Structure
- Models in `app/models/`
  - Business logic
  - ActiveRecord models
  - Plain Ruby objects
  - Service objects
- Controllers in `app/controllers/`
  - RESTful actions
  - Concerns
  - Base controllers
- Views in `app/views/`
  - Templates
  - Partials
  - Layouts
- Helpers in `app/helpers/`
  - View helpers
  - Application helpers
- Jobs in `app/jobs/`
  - Background jobs
  - Scheduled tasks
- Mailers in `app/mailers/`
  - Email templates
  - Mailer classes
- Channels in `app/channels/`
  - WebSocket channels
  - Channel classes
- Tests in `test/`
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - System tests

## Naming Conventions
- Use plural for controllers (PostsController)
- Use singular for models (Post)
- Use plural for tables (posts)
- Use snake_case for file names
- Use CamelCase for class names
- Use descriptive, purpose-indicating names
